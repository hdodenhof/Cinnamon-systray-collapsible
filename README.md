Cinnamon-systray-collapsible
============================

A collapsible system tray applet for Cinnamon compatible with the 2.6 release.

This is basically a rebase of [Cinnamon-systray-collapsible from Koutch](https://github.com/Koutch/Cinnamon-systray-collapsible) onto the Cinnamon 2.6 codebase. I stripped most customization options for now to get a first version up and running. So currently the applet hides all of your system tray icons, there is no way to keep single icons visible.

Be aware: I had no idea what I was doing. This is the first time for me to get into Cinnamon applet development so there might be some rough edges.

To install this just check out this repo into your Cinnamon applet directory, i.e. `~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/systray-collapsible@hdodenhof.de`.
